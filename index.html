<h3>Raygan Aurora</h3>
</div>
<p id="Ray">Raygan was born on April 8th 2009. She is the oldest of our three daughters and was an only child for her first 7 years. She is intellectually gifted and I love watching how her mind works. Raygan is a wonderful artist, loves chess, and knows some Mandarin. She is my Doctor Who watching buddy and I love when we get some one on one time together.</p>
